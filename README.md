# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A repository containing all the code and files used to create the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game

## The model

Using "Teachable Machine" to create a model with 4 different classes: "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing", I then downloaded the files corresponding to the model: "keras_model.h5" and "labels.txt"; the former contains the structure of the model and the latter contains the parameters. They will later be loaded to use in a Python script that will simulate a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.
